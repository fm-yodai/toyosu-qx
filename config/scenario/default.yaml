# Toyosu-QX Default Scenario
# Defines market topology, demand patterns, and fleet configuration
# Uses 2D grid coordinates where tares move on corridors (Manhattan distance)

# Simulation parameters
sim_duration_sec: 28800  # 8 hours (4:00-12:00)
random_seed: 42

# 2D Grid configuration
# Movement is restricted to horizontal/vertical (corridor-based)
grid:
  width: 30              # Grid width in cells
  height: 30             # Grid height in cells
  cell_size_m: 10.0      # Each cell is 10m x 10m

# Demand generation
demand:
  base_rate: 0.1         # Base order rate (orders per second)

  # Time-of-day intensity multipliers
  intensity_curve:
    "04:00": 0.5         # Early morning: low
    "06:00": 1.5         # Morning rush: high
    "08:00": 2.0         # Peak: very high
    "10:00": 1.0         # Mid-morning: medium
    "12:00": 0.3         # Near close: low

  # Order lot sizes (kg) and probabilities
  lot_sizes: [10, 30, 50]           # S, M, L
  lot_probabilities: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]  # 50% S, 30% M, 20% L

# Market topology (grid coordinates)
# The market is laid out on a grid:
#   - Wholesalers (仲卸) are at the bottom (y=2)
#   - Retailers (小売) are distributed in the upper area
#   - Tares travel along corridors (horizontal/vertical only)
nodes:
  # Wholesalers (仲卸) - bottom row
  - id: "W1"
    type: wholesaler
    x: 5
    y: 2
    name: "Wholesaler 1"

  - id: "W2"
    type: wholesaler
    x: 15
    y: 2
    name: "Wholesaler 2"

  - id: "W3"
    type: wholesaler
    x: 25
    y: 2
    name: "Wholesaler 3"

  # Retailers (小売) - distributed in upper area
  - id: "R1"
    type: retailer
    x: 3
    y: 15
    name: "Retailer 1"
